### Why I so thrilled about this position?

I’ve been working at Zoomit for years, and one aspect I truly love is building **Community**! Creating a smooth environment for people to connect makes me incredibly happy.

At Zoomit, I've contributed to developing an amazing community experience, including features like a **threaded comment section** packed with fun elements like stickers, spoilers, and mentions.

I’m also excited about your tech stack (React, Vite, Tailwind, Tiptap) and can’t wait to bring my passion to your team!
