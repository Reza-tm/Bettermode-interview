# Auth

### SSR :
1. The login API is located at `apis/auth`. When a user fills out the login form, this API is called to authenticate the user.
2. The API sets a `c_access_token` cookie. This token will be used for all future requests to ensure the user is authenticated.
3. We also set this token in our server-side Apollo Client.
4. This token is crucial for the `authGuard` middleware, allowing it to verify the user's authentication status.

### Auth guard:
The `authGuard` is a middleware that ensures users are authenticated before accessing private routes.
1. If user is already authenticated and tries to access an auth route, we will redirect them to the homepage
2. If the user is not authenticated,we will redirect to the login page.

### CSR:
1. After authentication, we store the user data (including the auth token) in the `window` object. This allows us to access it in our Apollo Client.
2. Once the user data is passed to Apollo Client, we remove the user data from the `window`.
